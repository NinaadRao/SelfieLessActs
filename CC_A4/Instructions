To define a multi-container app -

cd into the folder containing the Dockerfile and the docker-compose.yml file and run : docker-compose build
To run all services: docker-compose up

e.g
cd cc_users
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

To access your container's shell-

get the container id (docker ps)
docker exec -it <container_id> bash (e.g docker exec -it 9ca96a505f5f bash)

You can then run shell commands within your container

To get a log of what's happening on your container (incoming requests etc.) -

docker logs -f <container-name> (e.g docker logs -f cc_acts_mongo_1)

To shut down all containers - 
docker-compose down
